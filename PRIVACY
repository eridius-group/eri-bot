Eri (aka Helpy) is a Discord bot that logs a lot of information for the purposes of your work Discord server.
Information that is personally identifiable, such as your Discord ID and Discord Nickname for the server you share with Helpy, are logged on Eridius servers. This information can be erased via personal request by contacting eridian@eridi.us with the subject [DELETE] followed by your Discord ID. Note that after erasing any data associated with your ID, your employer may not be able to track previous hours, which can interfere with your payment. Additionally, if your employer decides to self-host Helpy, you would have to request from them that your data be erased, as we cannot remotely erase your data.
No further personally identifiable data is collected, no data is sold to advertisers or third parties, and you can generally see all data Helpy has on you by running `/pay export` and `/leaderboard`.
